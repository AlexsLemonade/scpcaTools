## Coding style

We generally follow the [tidyverse style](http://style.tidyverse.org/).
You can use the [`styler` package](https://styler.r-lib.org) to perform styling locally.
If code needs styling during/after a PR, one of the repository owners can perform styling automatically by making a comment with just the word `/style` in the PR.
