\title{Calculate within-batch ARI scores from an integrated SCE object.}
\usage{
calculate_within_batch_ari(
  individual_sce_list,
  pc_name,
  integrated_sce,
  batch_column = "library_id",
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{individual_sce_list}{A list of individual SCE objects}

\item{pc_name}{The name that allows access to the PCs. Example: fastMNN_PCA}

\item{integrated_sce}{The integrated SCE object}

\item{batch_column}{The variable in `integrated_sce` indicating the grouping of interest.
Generally this is either batches or cell types. Default is "library_id".}

\item{seed}{Seed for initializing random sampling}
}
\value{
Tibble with three columns: `ari`, representing the calculated ARI values;
  `batch_id`, the batch id associated with each `ari`; `pc_name`, the name
  associated with the pc results
}
