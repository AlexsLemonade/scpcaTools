\title{Read in counts data processed with Alevin or Alevin-fry}
\usage{
read_alevin(
  quant_dir,
  fry_mode = FALSE,
  include_unspliced = TRUE,
  feature_data = FALSE,
  round_counts = TRUE,
  library_id = NULL,
  sample_id = NULL,
  tech_version = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{quant_dir}{Path to directory where output files are located.}

\item{fry_mode}{Logical indicating if Alevin-fry was used for quantification.
Implies the input data is in matrix market format.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{include_unspliced}{Whether or not to include the unspliced reads in the counts matrix.
If TRUE, the main "counts" assay will contain unspliced reads and spliced reads and an additional "spliced"
assay will contain spliced reads only. If TRUE, requires that data has been aligned to a reference contianing
spliced and unspliced reads.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{feature_data}{Logical indicating if the data being read in contains feature data.
Default is FALSE. If feature data is being read in there are no spliced or unspliced reads.
All reads will be counted and stored in the `counts` assay.}

\item{round_counts}{Logical indicating in the count matrix should be rounded to integers on import.
Only used if `fry_mode` is FALSE. Default is TRUE.}

\item{library_id}{Optional library identifier}

\item{sample_id}{Optional sample identifier.
If multiplexed samples are included in a library, this may be a vector.}

\item{tech_version}{Technology or kit used to process library (i.e. 10Xv3, 10Xv3.1).}
}
\value{
SingleCellExperiment of unfiltered gene x cell counts matrix.
