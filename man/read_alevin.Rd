\usage{
read_alevin(
  quant_dir,
  intron_mode = FALSE,
  usa_mode = FALSE,
  which_counts = c("spliced", "unspliced")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{quant_dir}{Path to directory where output files are located.}

\item{intron_mode}{Logical indicating if the files included alignment to intronic regions.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{usa_mode}{Logical indicating if Alevin-fry was used, if USA mode was invoked.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{which_counts}{Which type of counts should be included,
only counts aligned to spliced cDNA ("spliced") or all spliced and unspliced cDNA ("unspliced").
Applies if `intron_mode` or `usa_mode` is TRUE.
Default is "spliced".}
